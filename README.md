Here you can see two different scripts for the following clustering methods depended on the train dataset you want to test:

->K-means(Euclidean distance)

->Agglomerative Hierarchical Clustering

Included, there are two scripts of an Autoencoder that uses one of the the methods, in each script, on it's dimensional reduced data.

In order to run one of the clustering methods scripts, you need to have the corresponding train dataset csv file in the same directory as the script you are trying to run.
